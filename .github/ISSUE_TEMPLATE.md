IMPORTANT: Please test with the latest released version before
reporting a bug: https://github.com/classgraph/classgraph/releases

When filing a new bug, please call `ClassGraph#verbose()` before
`ClassGraph#scan()`, and attach the generated verbose log to your
bug report. (You can attach log files by dragging and dropping
onto the GitHub issue editing pane.)

If possible, please create and attach a minimal, self-contained
testcase project that is able to trigger the bug. Bugfixes in the
form of pull requests are also very welcome.

Every attempt is made to be extremely responsive in fixing bugs
in ClassGraph (in contrast to many open source projects!).
However, please make sure you are receiving GitHub notifications
so that you can also respond to clarifying questions if necessary.
(GitHub notifications are disabled by default for some users.)

Thank you!
